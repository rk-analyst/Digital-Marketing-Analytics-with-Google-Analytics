Charcoal Games, the owner of the Flood-It! App, has just hired you to develop data-driven insights based on their Google Analytics data. Their management team has tasked you with answering the questions listed below. Finally, management has also explained that they are not interested in improving the aesthetics of the app (for example, do not recommend giving the app a facelift), and they are not interested in your process (focus on your results).

Note: Charcoal Games is NOT the actual owner of the Flood-It! App. We are using the data from Google Analytics to represent a similar game developed by this company.
